JS Web Application for Styling Your Box (v0.0.1)

**ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

"Change the Box" is a JavaScript web application that lets you style your box. While it currently focuses on boxes, the future vision includes introducing other shapes, more configuration options for changing styles, the ability to draw on objects, and perhaps even humanizing the box.

**Project Milestones:**

*Version 0.0.2 (Prototype):*
1) ✅ 3D Box using Three.js
2) ✅ GSAP animations
  
*Previous versions:*

Version 0.0.1:
1) ✅ Basic skeleton + initial styling
2) ✅ Basic interaction functionality

*Future Versions:*
1) Define optimal and intuitive controls for styling
2) Allow users to customize style configurations
3) Implement drawing features with various tools
4) Explore humanization elements for a more interactive experience
5) Integrate additional shapes for enhanced creativity

The inspiration for this project stems from www.javascript30.com and NFT trends. What I've built so far is a foundation, a prototype, and a glimpse into the creative possibilities that lie ahead.
