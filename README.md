JS Web Application for Styling Your Box (v0.0.1)

**ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

"Change the Box" is a JavaScript web application that lets you style your box. While it currently focuses on boxes, the future vision includes introducing other shapes, more configuration options for changing styles, the ability to draw on objects, and perhaps even humanizing the box.

**Project Milestones:**
  
*Version 0.0.1 (Prototype):*
1) ✅ Basic skeleton + initial styling
2) ✅ Basic interaction functionality
3) ⚙️ Future-proofing for additional shapes and configurations
4) ⚙️ Framework for drawing on objects
5) ⚙️ Initial steps towards humanizing the box

*Future Versions:*
1) Define optimal and intuitive controls for styling
2) Allow users to customize style configurations
3) Implement drawing features with various tools
4) Explore humanization elements for a more interactive experience
5) Integrate additional shapes for enhanced creativity

The inspiration for this project stems from www.javascript30.com, NFT trends, and the engaging world of mobile games. What I've built so far is a foundation, a prototype, and a glimpse into the creative possibilities that lie ahead.

As "Change the Box" grows, I can't wait to see the smiles it brings. Here's to styling and smiling! 🎉🖌️
